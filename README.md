# Welcome to my Orinoco e-commerce project

## About the project

This is the 5th project I made for my [Web Developer program at OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/185-developpeur-web). :mortar_board:

The goal was to develop the front-end of an eCommerce Website, using the JavaScript programming language to interact with users and external services. I also had to apply a test-driven approach.

To see the result, you need to follow the instructions of [this repo](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5) to install the node server and the pre-made API. Then you'll be able to see the website I developed locally on your machine.

I used : 
* HTML5
* CSS3
* ECMAScript 6 version of JavaScript
* SASS
* Flexbox
* Bootstrap 4
* [PostCSS autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#options)
* A package.json file
